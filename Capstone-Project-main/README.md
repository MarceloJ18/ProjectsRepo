## Project Description

This project comes for the completion of a university course - Capstone Project - in the third year of a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science at Nova IMS.

Our company, AiTHLETES,  was designed to get data insights from the F1 world. The major objective of our company is to help F1 fans all over the globe get a complete perspective on all aspects of Formula 1.  

The project aims to develop an interface specialized in F1 history - the F1 Pilot - as well as being able to predict the drivers' standings with each grand prix data. Also, it is supposed to help any user with their F1 Fantasy Team being able to adapt to any restrictions existing in the fantasy rules and help users build their ideal team.

In addition, a website was also developed, where our F1 Pilot was inserted. There, users can find several pages where they can interact with everyone and even with the developers of this project via the site's F1 Blog; a Data Hub where up-to-date data is powerfully displayed and in a user-friendly manner; and a comment section where everyone can give suggestions via email to the marketing department.

This way, as the fanbase of the sport keeps on growing, we are looking to spread more accessible data insights about everything that is going on weekly on the track! With the power of artificial intelligence, we can be side by side with any question our users might have daily.

### - What main technologies were used in the development of this project?
For this project, the main goal was to create an AI-powered Conversational System that would engage with any type of potential Formula One fans. This would be the primary communication channel of our business - being able to assist our users in getting to know more facts about historical data, landing some insights about the last race, as well as their fantasy team changing possibilities; and mostly, to help them to have a better possibility of guessing the future race winners with the predictive model implemented that was implemented. All this by using the conversational app - the F1 Pilot. 

With this project, we were able to explore more in-depth how to make use of LLM models, from OpenAI, in different problems (with Python being the chosen programming language) - through the development of a chatbot capable of handling (and reproducing) a smooth conversation about facts and possible doubts that the Pilot's users may have. Furthermore, it was also the objective for the AI to be able to predict which drivers are more likely to win the following races as well as who might be the best fit for their fantasy team, by making use of a Forecasting model that was developed for the utilized time-series data. Furthermore, by making use of the Streamlit package, the group developed a full Web Application with several tabs, filling them with easy-to-understand knowledge making the information available accessible to the most casual fan or even to a new follower of the World's Most Entertaining Motorsport.

### - What were the main challenges faced? 
The main challenges faced during the development of this project were related with:
- The Team's limited budget in OpenAi made it very hard to use and interact with the chat. Hence, there was a need to become more cautious and restrict some of the parts of the development stage;
- The team's original idea of data to provide to the AI, turned out to be impossible to achieve. There were tons of files, some of them with thousands of rows, which made the code prompt errors on several occasions stating that the tokens could not be embedded;
- As the majority of Formula 1 data is based on tables or comma-separated values files (.csv), it was not always possible for the ChatBot to get new information from those types of files. We were required to change our approach and create new PDFs filled with the previously tabled data. Even then, this approach did not yield great results and was disregarded;
- The chatbot required very specific instructions to ensure the correct outputs were obtained, which was an extremely time-consuming process (sort of trial and error);

#### Repository Description
The repository has many files, though the only trully important ones to run have to do with streamlit.
ChatbotFunctions holds the functions that were to be given to the bot properly formatted. Both chat_app and chat_bot represent the code needed to display and create the bot respectively.
prompt_list has the system prompt for the bot.
The most important data for the bot is held in DataFiltered2022_2023, with PDFs and CSV (though the amount was cut down for tokens per minutes in embeddings.
F1_Fantasy was kept to show how the Fantasy F1 data was retrieved, though some changes were made on Excel later on to make it more interpretable.
OldData and OldNotebooks hold many iterations of models and data that the team attempted to feed the model, with some inspirations being taken from some of those previous¬†models.

#### How To Use the Project. How to Install and Run the Project
Our project was created solely with the use of the streamlit package (excluding the required packages for a user to be able to run the code that shows throughout the various pages). So, in order for someone to open our streamlit web application, the following steps need to be taken to ensure that the chatbot interface can be correctly assessed:

- Retrieve the code from this GitHub Repository (by doing `Fork` and then `Git Clone`);
- Open the notebook `1_üèéÔ∏è_Homepage` file in your code editor;
- In the menu that appears to your left, use the right button of your mouse and select the option that states `Open in Integrated Terminal`;
- And in the Terminal that pops up, enter the code `streamlit run 1_üèéÔ∏è_Homepage.py`;

Then all you need to do is enjoy the experience of using our F1 Hub!

#### How to Interact with the F1 Pilot:
Our chatbot is able to answer questions regarding both the latest Fantasy Formula 1 season (with the points system change being part of the reason why only the latest is used) alongside answering questions regarding the regulations of the 2023 Formula 1 season.
Functions were created for the chatbot to also display on-track speed comparisons between 2 drivers during a session (using their best lap time), draw the circuit with numbered corners, and find the optimal fantasy team for a race, alongside prediction on the formula 1 data (which, due to its size, was not able to be fed onto the chatbot).
At the moment, these functions were prepared to be put on the code but are not readily available, in much due to a lack of information on the classes and difficulty in finding more information¬†in¬†time.
